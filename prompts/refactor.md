# Refactor Code

Please help me refactor the selected code or file. Consider:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve naming
   - Simplify complex logic
   - Extract reusable functions/components

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize algorithms
   - Reduce unnecessary operations
   - Consider caching where appropriate

3. **Maintainability**
   - Add appropriate abstractions
   - Improve code organization
   - Ensure SOLID principles

4. **Testing**
   - Ensure refactored code maintains test coverage
   - Add tests if missing

Please explain the refactoring approach before making changes.
