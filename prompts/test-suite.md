# Create/Improve Test Suite

Please help me create or improve tests for this code. Focus on:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests for all functions/methods
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Edge cases and error handling

2. **Test Quality**
   - Clear test names that describe what's being tested
   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Appropriate use of mocks/stubs

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests
   - Use appropriate test fixtures
   - Minimize test duplication

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Identify what needs testing
   - Prioritize critical paths
   - Consider performance tests if needed

Please analyze the current test coverage first, then add missing tests.
