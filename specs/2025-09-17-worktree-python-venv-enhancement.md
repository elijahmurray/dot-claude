# Enhanced Worktree Python Virtual Environment Support

## Overview
Enhanced the worktree creation script to automatically detect and setup Python virtual environments in subdirectories, resolving the "Virtual environment not found" error that occurs when Python projects use a subdirectory structure (like `backend/requirements.txt`).

## User Requirements
- Worktrees should be immediately functional after creation
- Virtual environments should be created in the correct directories
- Support for common project structures (full-stack, microservices)
- Clear troubleshooting guidance when issues occur

## Technical Specifications

### Multi-Directory Python Detection
The script now searches for `requirements.txt` in multiple common locations:
- Root directory (`.`)
- `backend/`
- `api/`
- `server/`
- `app/`
- `src/`

### Virtual Environment Creation
- Creates virtual environments in the same directory as `requirements.txt`
- Each Python project gets its own isolated environment
- Supports multiple Python projects in one repository
- Example: `backend/requirements.txt` â†’ creates `backend/venv/`

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Pre-flight Python availability check
- Graceful fallback when Python is not installed
- Clear status reporting for each environment
- Manual setup commands provided on failure

### User Feedback Improvements
- Shows Python version detected
- Lists all created virtual environments
- Provides activation instructions for each environment
- Includes troubleshooting section with common solutions
- Final verification summary

## Files Modified

### `/scripts/worktree-create.sh`
- Added `setup_python_env()` function for modular environment setup
- Enhanced Python detection to check multiple directories
- Added Python availability check before attempting setup
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive verification step

### `/commands/cmd-worktree-create.md`
- Updated documentation to reflect multi-directory support
- Added common project structure examples
- Included virtual environment activation guide
- Added troubleshooting section

## Key Decisions

1. **Directory-Specific Virtual Environments**: Each subdirectory with `requirements.txt` gets its own `venv/` to maintain isolation

2. **Common Directory Patterns**: Chose to check the most common Python project subdirectories based on typical full-stack and microservices patterns

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Script continues working even if Python is not available, providing manual instructions

4. **Verbose Feedback**: Opted for detailed output to help users understand what's happening and troubleshoot issues

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Verify syntax with `bash -n`
- [x] Test detection logic with multiple directory structures
- [ ] Test with actual worktree creation (manual verification needed)
- [ ] Verify virtual environment activation works in subdirectories

## Dependencies
- Python 3 (or Python 2.7+)
- bash 4.0+
- Standard Unix tools (sed, grep, find)

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Language Support**: Could extend pattern to handle Ruby (Gemfile), Go (go.mod), Rust (Cargo.toml)

2. **Custom Directory Detection**: Could read from a config file for non-standard project structures

3. **Dependency Caching**: Could cache pip packages between worktrees to speed up creation

4. **Virtual Environment Sharing**: Could optionally share virtual environments between worktrees for the same branch

## Implementation Notes

The enhancement was prompted by a user experiencing "Virtual environment not found" errors when running servers from worktrees. The root cause was that the original script only checked for `requirements.txt` in the root directory, missing common patterns like `backend/requirements.txt` in full-stack applications.

This fix ensures worktrees are immediately functional regardless of project structure, reducing friction in the development workflow.
