# git-cleanup-improvements Feature Specification

**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Feature**: git-cleanup-improvements  
**Status**: Complete  

## Overview

Enhanced the `/cmd-git-cleanup` command to properly detect and clean up branches merged via Pull Requests, addressing a critical issue where the command failed to identify merged branches when the local main branch was outdated.

## User Requirements

The user identified that the initial git cleanup command had several critical issues:

1. **Main branch was outdated**: Local main was 17 commits behind origin/main, causing merged branches to appear unmerged
2. **PR-based merges not detected**: Branches merged via GitHub PRs (especially squash/rebase) weren't being detected
3. **No remote branch cleanup**: Remote branches weren't being cleaned up
4. **Poor database detection**: Database cleanup logic had detection issues
5. **Lack of safety features**: No dry-run mode or interactive confirmations
6. **Missing error handling**: Script would fail without proper error reporting

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Details

1. **Main Branch Update Logic**
   - Always fetch and update main branch before checking merge status
   - Support both 'main' and 'master' branch names
   - Use `git pull --ff-only` with fallback to `git reset --hard origin/main`

2. **Enhanced Merge Detection Function (`is_branch_merged`)**
   - Traditional merge check: `git branch --merged`
   - PR merge detection via commit comparison: `git cherry` and `git rev-list`
   - Git log search for merge commits mentioning the branch
   - Protection for important branches (main, master, develop, staging, production)

3. **Safety Features**
   - Dry-run mode (`--dry-run` or `dry-run` argument)
   - Interactive confirmations (default on, disable with second argument)
   - Check for uncommitted changes before running
   - Protected branches list to prevent accidental deletion

4. **Database Cleanup Enhancement**
   - Multiple detection methods for main database name
   - Check various .env file locations
   - Support multiple environment variable patterns (DATABASE_URL, DB_NAME, POSTGRES_DB)
   - Fallback to psql database listing

### Files Modified/Created

1. **commands/cmd-git-cleanup.md** - Complete rewrite with enhanced functionality
2. **scripts/git-cleanup.sh** - New standalone executable script for testing

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Atomic Operations**: Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
2. **Grep Pipe Safety**: Added `|| true` to grep commands to prevent pipeline failures
3. **Remote Branch Parsing**: Fixed to use `git branch -r | sed` instead of broken `--format` approach
4. **Database Detection**: Made function return optional with `|| true` to handle missing databases gracefully
5. **Counting Logic**: Use arithmetic expressions `((COUNT++))` for proper counting
6. **Recovery Information**: Always provide tips for recovering accidentally deleted branches

## Testing Requirements

1. Test dry-run mode without any changes being made
2. Verify main branch update before merge checking
3. Test detection of PR-merged branches (squash, rebase, merge)
4. Verify remote branch cleanup functionality
5. Test database detection with various .env configurations
6. Verify protected branches are never deleted
7. Test interactive and non-interactive modes

## Dependencies

- Git (with support for worktrees)
- Bash shell with standard utilities (grep, sed, xargs)
- PostgreSQL client (`psql`) for database cleanup (optional)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for remote operations (optional)

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Protection**: Could add regex patterns for protected branch names
2. **Parallel Operations**: Could parallelize branch checks for performance
3. **Backup Creation**: Could create a backup script before deletion
4. **Integration with Issue Trackers**: Could check if branches have open issues/PRs
5. **Custom Merge Strategies**: Support for non-standard merge workflows
6. **Multi-Remote Support**: Handle repositories with multiple remotes

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Fixes Applied

1. **Main Branch Update**: Added `git pull origin "$MAIN_BRANCH" --ff-only` before any merge checks
2. **Enhanced Merge Detection**: Implemented multiple detection methods to catch PR merges
3. **Remote Branch Parsing**: Fixed parsing issue that incorrectly identified "origin" as a branch
4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error trapping and optional returns for robust operation
5. **Database Function**: Made database detection optional to prevent script failure

### Usage Patterns

```bash
# Preview changes (safe)
/cmd-git-cleanup dry-run

# Run with confirmations (default)
/cmd-git-cleanup

# Auto-yes mode (no confirmations)
/cmd-git-cleanup no no

# Dry-run without confirmations
/cmd-git-cleanup dry-run no
```

### Recovery Commands

Users can recover deleted branches using:
- `git reflog | grep <branch-name>`
- `git checkout -b <branch-name> <commit-hash>`
- `git fetch origin <branch-name>` (for remote branches)

This implementation ensures that the git cleanup command is now reliable, safe, and comprehensive in detecting all types of merged branches.
