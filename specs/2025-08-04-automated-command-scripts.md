# Automated Command Scripts

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Feature**: Convert interactive commands to automated scripts  
**Branch**: main  
**Type**: Developer Experience Enhancement  

## Problem Statement

The current command system required manual user interaction with prompts and pressing enter at each step, breaking the developer workflow. Commands like `/cmd-pr-create` and `/cmd-claude-update` would stop and wait for user input, making them inefficient for automated workflows.

## Solution Overview

Convert interactive commands to use automated bash scripts that eliminate manual prompts while preserving all validation and safety checks.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Script Architecture
- **Commands remain as `/cmd-*`** - preserved user interface
- **Scripts added to `.claude/scripts/`** - contain the automation logic
- **Commands call scripts** - clean separation of concerns

### 2. Scripts Created

#### `pr-create.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automated PR creation without manual prompts
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic GitHub CLI detection
  - Documentation validation (warns instead of prompting)
  - Git status checks and branch pushing
  - PR creation with auto-generated titles and bodies
- **Usage**: `./claude/scripts/pr-create.sh [branch] [title] [body]`

#### `setup-ticket-system.sh`
- **Purpose**: Interactive ticket management system configuration
- **Features**:
  - Menu-driven selection of ticket systems
  - Automatic CLAUDE.md editing and cleanup
  - CLI tool detection and installation guidance
  - Backup creation before modifications
- **Usage**: `.claude/scripts/setup-ticket-system.sh`

#### `claude-update.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automated submodule updates
- **Features**:
  - Automatic update without Y/N prompts
  - Force flag for CI/automation environments
  - Submodule status checking and validation
  - Change summary display
- **Usage**: `.claude/scripts/claude-update.sh [--force]`

### 3. Command Updates

All affected commands were updated to:
- Call their corresponding scripts
- Remove inline bash code blocks
- Maintain documentation and usage examples
- Preserve purpose and troubleshooting sections

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes
- **Modified**: `commands/cmd-pr-create.md`
- **Modified**: `commands/cmd-setup-ticket-system.md` 
- **Modified**: `commands/cmd-claude-update.md`
- **Added**: `scripts/pr-create.sh`
- **Added**: `scripts/setup-ticket-system.sh`
- **Added**: `scripts/claude-update.sh`

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Option A Approach**: Kept existing GitHub CLI logic, avoided scope creep of multi-platform detection
2. **Preserved Safety**: All validation checks and error handling maintained
3. **Backward Compatible**: Commands still work the same way for users
4. **Executable Scripts**: All scripts have proper permissions and shebang lines

## Benefits

### Developer Experience
- **No More Manual Prompts**: Commands run completely automatically
- **Faster Workflow**: No stopping to press enter or answer Y/N questions
- **CI/Automation Ready**: Scripts work in headless environments
- **Argument Support**: Scripts accept parameters for customization

### Maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic moved to dedicated scripts
- **Easier Testing**: Scripts can be tested independently
- **Version Control**: Scripts are properly tracked and versioned
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in scripts

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Before (required manual interaction)
/cmd-pr-create
# Would stop at: "Continue anyway? (y/n):"

# After (fully automated)
/cmd-pr-create
# Runs completely without prompts

# Scripts can also be called directly
.claude/scripts/pr-create.sh "feature/auth" "Add authentication feature"
.claude/scripts/claude-update.sh --force
```

## Testing

Manual testing confirmed:
- All scripts execute successfully
- Commands properly call their scripts
- Error handling works as expected
- Validation checks are preserved
- Scripts have proper permissions

## Migration Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing command interface unchanged
- **Gradual Adoption**: Other commands can be converted using this pattern
- **Documentation**: All commands retain their documentation and examples

## Future Enhancements

Potential follow-up improvements:
1. Convert other commands with manual prompts to scripts
2. Add more script arguments for customization
3. Create test suite for script validation
4. Add logging and verbose mode options

## Conclusion

Successfully eliminated manual prompts from key commands while preserving all functionality and safety checks. The new script-based architecture provides a foundation for future command automation improvements.
