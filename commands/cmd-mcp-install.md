You are a Claude Code assistant. Your task is to install an MCP server, either from a GitHub repository or from popular pre-configured options, and register it with `claude mcp` using either project scope or user scope, based on user choice.

## Quick Install Options

First, offer these popular MCP servers for quick installation:

### Popular MCP Servers:
- **Git** - Work with git repositories (`uvx mcp-server-git`)
- **Linear** - Integrate with Linear project management (`npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse`)
- **GitHub** - GitHub repository access
- **Filesystem** - Local file system access
- **SQLite** - SQLite database access
- **PostgreSQL** - PostgreSQL database access
- **Custom** - Install from GitHub repository URL

**Navigation**: Use **spacebar** to toggle selection, **Enter** to proceed with selected options.

## Custom Installation Steps

If user chooses "Custom" or provides a GitHub URL:

1. Ask the user for the GitHub URL of the MCP server repository.
2. Clone the repository into a temporary directory.
3. Inspect installation instructions (README or docs) automatically.
4. Determine runtime (e.g. Node.js, Python, TS/JS build script).
5. Install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`, `pip install -e .`, `bun install`).
6. Ask user: install globally (user‚Äëscope) or local to project.
7. Based on user answer, choose install location:
   - User‚Äëscope (~/.local or global path)
   - Project‚Äëscope (current directory)
8. Ensure the MCP executable is available (e.g. a binary script or `node dist/index.js`, or `uvx mcp-server-git`).
9. Prepare JSON config object:

{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "/full/path/to/executable",
  "args": [...],
  "env": { ... }
}

10. Confirm with user, then run:

claude mcp add-json serverName ''

or

claude mcp add serverName /path/to/executable arg1 arg2

11. Then run:

claude mcp list

and report success or failure.

## Pre-configured Server Commands

### Linear MCP
```bash
claude mcp add-json linear '{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"]
}'
```

### Git MCP  
```bash
claude mcp add git uvx mcp-server-git --repository /path/to/repo
```

---

Prompt the user at each decision point clearly. Use this assistant prompt to automate effectively.

### üí° Example Usage:

User: I want to install the Git MCP server from https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/src/git
As Claude: ‚ÄúGreat‚Äîshall I install it for project scope or user scope?‚Äù

The assistant will then walk through cloning, reading guidelines, installing dependencies, and registering the MCP server via the appropriate `claude mcp add(-json)` command.
