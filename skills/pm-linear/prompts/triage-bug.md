# Triage Bug

## Purpose
Help categorize, prioritize, and document a bug report.

## Workflow

1. **Gather Information**
   - What is the bug? (symptoms)
   - How to reproduce?
   - What's the expected behavior?
   - What's the actual behavior?
   - Any error messages or logs?

2. **Assess Severity**
   - **Critical**: System down, data loss, security issue
   - **High**: Major feature broken, no workaround
   - **Medium**: Feature impaired, workaround exists
   - **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic, edge case

3. **Categorize**
   - Area of codebase affected
   - Related features or components
   - Potential root causes

4. **Recommend Priority**
   Based on: severity + frequency + user impact + effort estimate

5. **Document**
   - Create ticket using bug template
   - Include reproduction steps
   - Link related issues if any

## Questions to Ask
If information is missing, ask:
- "Can you describe the steps to reproduce this?"
- "What were you expecting to happen?"
- "How often does this occur?"
- "Is there a workaround?"
